# setvol

do you love volume? do you love controlling it? do you hate that your GUI gets a say in what volume you are hearing sounds at? then this is the script for you.

I wrote this quick script because I have outdated sound hardware and the proper drivers no longer exist. by directly overloading the built in sound server you can set the volume through command line. note: this is unironically how I change volume on my computer.  

for use on linux systems using PulseAudio, i.e. debian.  
usage: setvol [percent of volume]  
e.g., setvol 400 sets your volume to 400% maximum
